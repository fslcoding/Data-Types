# Data Types

A data type ( commonly refered to as just '**_type_**' ), specifies the size of the variable, and what type of data it can store.

Here are some common types:

+ ```string``` stores many characters
+ ```char``` stores one character
+ ```int``` stores a whole number
+ ```double``` stores a decimal number
+ ```bool``` stores a true or false

Check out [Program.cs](https://github.com/fslcoding/Data_Types_CS/blob/main/Program.cs) to see examples of these types.

Some less common types include:

+ ```short``` half the size of ```int```
+ ```long``` double size of ```int```
+ ```float``` floating point number

### Converting between types

To convert between types, you use the ```Convert``` class, and you also need to use the ``` . ``` syntax.

Here is a basic example:

```
string var1 = "5";

int var2 = Convert.ToInt32(var1);
```
var2 would be an integer of value 5.

_N.B. Converting is prone to errors, and you should always utilise a [**_Try Catch_**](https://github.com/fslcoding/Try_Catch_CS) when using them._

Another way to convert similar types is a [**_Cast_**](https://github.com/fslcoding/Casting_CS).



### **_Advanced_**

To create your own type, you can make a struct, class, or record



```
struct Car {
    public string CarName;
    public string Colour;
}
```

```
class Car {
    string CarName;
    string Colour;
}
```

```
public record Car(string CarName, string Colour);
```
